ðŸ“˜ **Extended Description of the TEM Cost Optimization Model**
The Telecom Expense Management (TEM) Cost Optimization Model is a data-driven solution developed using Python and Snowflake to proactively manage and reduce telecom expenditures at the user level. The primary objective of this model is to identify users incurring overage charges and recommend more cost-effective data plans, enabling companies to make informed decisions that significantly reduce monthly telecom costs.

**ðŸ”§ Technical Workflow
Database Connectivity:**

The model establishes a secure connection with the Snowflake data warehouse using the snowflake.connector module.

It accesses a centralized usage_report table which contains detailed telecom usage metrics for each user, including monthly_usage_gb, overage_gb, and total_cost.

**Data Extraction & Filtering:**

It runs a SQL query to retrieve only those users who have incurred overage charges (overage_gb > 0) â€” these are the primary cost drivers and targets for optimization.

**Plan Recommendation Logic:**

Based on the user's total usage, the model applies a conditional logic to recommend one of two predefined plans:

10 GB Plan at $50/month (for users with moderate data usage)

Unlimited VDM Plan at $75/month (for high-usage users)

This logic can be extended to include more plans or dynamic pricing based on contract terms or vendor catalogs.

**Cost Comparison & Savings Calculation:**

For each user, the model compares the recommended plan cost with their current total cost.

If the new plan is cheaper, it calculates the potential monthly savings, which are then added to a recommendations list.

**Report Generation:**

The final output is a clear, tabulated report showing:

User ID, Recommended Plan, Current Cost, New Cost, and Monthly Savings

This makes it easy for operations or finance teams to take corrective actions.

**Resource Management:**

The script ensures proper cleanup of the database cursor and connection to avoid any resource leaks.

**ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact**
Cost Savings: Helps reduce telecom costs by moving users to more efficient plans.

Transparency: Provides a clear audit trail of plan recommendations and savings.

Scalability: Can be expanded to include voice/SMS usage, roaming charges, or multi-vendor scenarios.

Automation Potential: Can be scheduled as a monthly job or integrated into a dashboard for continuous monitoring.

**ðŸ“ˆ Enhancements & Integration Opportunities**
Power BI Dashboard: Visualize users with highest savings potential and overage trends over time.

Alert System: Trigger email alerts for users crossing defined thresholds.

Machine Learning: Predict future overages and suggest plans proactively.

Contract Management: Integrate with vendor rate cards to benchmark against available plans.
